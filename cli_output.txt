      Evidence: Parameter 'unused_param' is never used in function body
  [!] Line 19 in something_risky(): [MEDIUM] equality_none_comparison
      Use 'is None' instead of '== None'
      Evidence: '== None' can be overridden by __eq__, use 'is None' for identity check
  [!!] Line 25 in something_risky(): [HIGH] bare_except
      Bare 'except:' clause catches all exceptions including KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit
      Evidence: Use 'except Exception:' or specific exception types
  [!!] Line 25 in something_risky(): [HIGH] empty_exception_handler
      Empty exception handler silently swallows errors
      Evidence: Exception is caught but not handled or logged
  [!!] Line 38 in something_risky(): [HIGH] self_comparison_always_false
      Comparing variable to itself is always False
      Evidence: x != x, x < x, x > x are always False

      Empty exception handler silently swallows errors
      Evidence: Exception is caught but not handled or logged
  [!!!] Line 77 in something_risky(): [CRITICAL] swallowed_exception
      Catching broad 'Exception' and ignoring it
      Evidence: This hides all errors and makes debugging impossible

  [!!] Line 89 in something_risky(): [HIGH] constant_condition
      Condition is always False
      Evidence: 'if False:' makes the if branch unreachable (dead code)
  [!] Line 92 in duplicate_conditions(): [MEDIUM] possible_missing_return
      Function 'duplicate_conditions' may not return on all code paths
      Evidence: All return statements are inside conditional blocks
  [!!] Line 96 in something_risky(): [HIGH] duplicate_condition
      Duplicate condition in if/elif chain
      Evidence: This condition was already checked earlier, branch is unreachable
  [!!] Line 96 in something_risky(): [HIGH] duplicate_condition
      elif has same condition as if - branch is unreachable
      Evidence: The if branch already handles this condition
  [!] Line 104 in something_risky(): [MEDIUM] always_true_condition
      Condition 'x or not x' is always True
      Evidence: Tautology in OR expression - condition is redundant
